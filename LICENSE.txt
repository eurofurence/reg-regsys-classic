A Note on Trademark issues:
---------------------------

When using the Eurofurence regsys, you are expected to replace the
logos associated with Eurofurence e.V., in particular the large side banner
wolf logo found in 

    html/ef/images/logo.jpg

and you may not use the name "Eurofurence" for your own purposes. Please
go through all templates found under src/tpl and adapt them to your needs.
Further customization may be needed - to a lesser degree - regarding the
files under src/html.

It is of course appreciated if you link to Eurofurence as the entity who
provided you with this free software, especially if your event is a "furry"
convention, and it is of course ok if that link mentions "Eurofurence".
